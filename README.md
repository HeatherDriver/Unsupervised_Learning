Project: Identify Customer Segments

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments could then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that have the highest expected rate of returns. This notebook provides a framework within which the analysis steps were taken. Please see the Discussion within the Markdown cells, where I show findings, as well as document the decisions that I made in my approach to each subtask.

A summary of the steps taken is also described.
