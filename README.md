Project: Identify Customer Segments

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments could then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that have the highest expected rate of returns. This notebook provides a framework within which the analysis steps were taken. Please see the Discussion within the Markdown cells, where I show findings, as well as document the decisions that I made in my approach to each subtask. I have also included a summary of the steps taken per major point.

This project was quite long and intense and the majority of focus was on cleaning the data and ensuring that decisions to drop features and remove lines still maintained the overall integrity of the data. While the eventual clusters did not appear to differ that much from each other except on the basis of the individual's financial status, this finding also made sense overall.

Personally I really enjoyed this project and getting into unsupervised learning. A definite highlight was looking at the PCA components and seeing how PCA can successfully derive main themes from features within each component. It definitely makes linear algebra a lot more interesting! :)
